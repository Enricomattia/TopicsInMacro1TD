# Instructions

Welcome to the course repository! In the folder "lectures" you can find the pdf version of all the TD sessions and a schedule for the semester. 

Instead, if you click on the link below, you can find some codes that solve and plot the Solow-Swan model! I tried to make it as straightforward as possible by including instructions. Just click on the link and see if you are able to play around with the code. Good luck!
